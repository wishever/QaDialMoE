# Dataset
We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets HEALTHVER ([Sarrouti et al., 2021](https://github.com/sarrouti/healthver)), FAVIQ ([Park et al., 2022](https://github.com/faviq/faviq)) and COLLOQUIAL ([Kim et al., 2021](https://github.com/bckim92/colloquial-claims)).
+ The DPR retrieved results with silver evidentiality labels can be downloaded from [Asai et al., 2021](https://github.com/AkariAsai/evidentiality_qa).
+ We generate synthetic questions for COLLOQUIAL dataset, and our dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_JSskGCxLbOvuaqxbi2BsM8MZbpiJd3M?usp=sharing).
